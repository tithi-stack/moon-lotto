## Critical Rules & Notes

### Top Prize (5/5 + GN)
- **Annuity Option**: $1,000 a day for life (guaranteed for 20 years minimum).
- **Lump Sum Option**: $7,000,000 cash.
- **Multiple Winners**: If there is more than one winner, the $7,000,000 lump sum is shared equally. The annuity option is **not** available for shared prizes.

### Second Prize (5/5)
- **Annuity Option**: $25,000 a year for life (guaranteed for 20 years minimum).
- **Lump Sum Option**: $500,000 cash.
- **Multiple Winners**: If there is more than one winner, the $500,000 lump sum is shared equally.

### Grand Number
- The Grand Number is drawn from a separate pool of 1 to 7.
- Matching only the Grand Number yields a Free Play.

### Evaluation & Tracking
- **Calculated Winnings**: For dashboard purposes, assume the **Lump Sum** value ($7,000,000 or $500,000) when calculating hypothetical winnings for the top two tiers, as annuities vary by winner age/choice.
- **Shared Prizes**: Since the simulator assumes a single winner, use the full prize amount.

### Historical Context
- Daily Grand was launched in October 2016.
- In recent years, an additional draw day (Monday) was added (originally only Thursday).
