## 2. Gold Ball Draw
Every ticket includes a unique 10-digit **Gold Ball Draw Number** (e.g., `12345678-01`).
- **Guaranteed Winner**: One Gold Ball Draw Number is drawn exactly from all tickets sold for that draw.
- **The Jackpot Draw**: The winner of the Gold Ball Draw Number gets a chance at the Gold Ball Jackpot.
    - A specialized draw is held with **Balls** remaining in the machine.
    - **White Balls**: Worth **$1 Million**.
    - **Gold Ball**: Worth the **Gold Ball Jackpot**.

### Gold Ball Mechanics
- **Start**: The sequence starts with **30 Balls** (29 White, 1 Gold).
- **Jackpot Base**: The Gold Ball Jackpot starts at **$10 Million**.
- **Process**:
    - If a **White Ball** is drawn: The winner gets **$1 Million**. The White Ball is removed. The Gold Ball Jackpot increases by **$2 Million** for the next draw.
    - If the **Gold Ball** is drawn: The winner gets the current **Gold Ball Jackpot**. The game resets to 30 balls and $10 Million for the next draw.
- **Max Jackpot**: If the Gold Ball is not drawn for 29 draws, only the Gold Ball remains. The jackpot caps at **$68 Million** and *must* be won on the 30th draw (odds become 1 in 1).

### Odds
- **Winning the Gold Ball Draw Entry**: Depends on total tickets sold (1 in Total Plays).
- **Winning the Gold Ball Jackpot (given you won the entry)**: 1 in N (where N is remaining balls, 30 down to 1).
